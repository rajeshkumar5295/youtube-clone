1. Check the Firebase Console for any error messages
2. Verify your Firebase project settings
3. Make sure all services are enabled and properly configured

## ðŸ”„ Temporary Solution

Until Firestore is properly configured, the app will:
- Save videos to Firebase Storage (working)
- Save video metadata to local storage (fallback)
- Display videos from local storage
- Show Firebase status in the profile page

This ensures the app works even without Firestore, but for full functionality, please complete the Firebase setup.
